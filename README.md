## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Colors

I've learnt the new hsl color notation and how to use it in custom properties to manipulate the opacity.

Instead of writing:

```css
--clr-primary: hsl(230, 35%, 7%);
```

You use just the numbers without any commas:

```css
--clr-primary: 230 35% 7%;
```

Later, in order to use the color, you need to remember about writing hsl(). If you want to change opacity, you add it after a backslash:

```css
.bg-primary-medium {
  background-color: hsl(var(--clr-primary) / 0.5);
}
```

You don't need to write `hsla()` for the alpha channel to work.

#### Paddings

You can use clamp(), min() and max() functions for paddings to get them grow and shrink without media queries:

```css
.element-1 {
  padding: 1.5rem clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3.5rem);
}

.element-2 {
  padding-block: min(4rem, 20vh);
}
```

#### Fonts

You can use clamp() for fonts. It's a good idea to use `+1rem` for the middle value so that font size is always in `rem`:

```css
--fs-900: clamp(5rem, 10vw + 1rem, 9.375rem);
```

#### Accessibility

##### Skip to content link

To make websites easier to navigate for people who use keyboard only, you can add a link enabling them to jump straight to main content without having to tab through the navigation menu. The `href` attribute needs to point to the `id` of main content and it's good to have `aria-label` describing what the link does. The link can be hidden with positioning and transforms.

```html
<a
  href="#main-content"
  class="skip-to-content"
  aria-label="skip to main content"
  >Skip to content</a
>

<main id="main-content"></main>
```

```css
.skip-to-content {
  position: absolute;
  padding: 0.5em 1em;
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(-100%);
  transition: opacity 300ms ease-in-out, transform 300ms ease-in-out;
}

.skip-to-content:focus {
}
```

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
